# The Amazon DynamoDB Object Mapper Sample (Swift)

This sample demonstrates the DynamoDB object mapper found in the AWS SDK for iOS.

## Requirements

* Xcode 7 and later
* iOS 8 and later

## Using the Sample

1. The AWS Mobile SDK for iOS is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). If you have not installed CocoaPods, install CocoaPods:

		sudo gem install cocoapods
		pod setup

1. To install the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS, simply add the following line to your **Podfile**:

		pod "AWSiOSSDKv2"

	Then run the following command:
	
		pod install

1. In the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/), use Amazon Cognito to create a new identity pool. Obtain the `AccountID`, `PoolID`, and `RoleUnauth` constants. Make sure the [role](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#roles) has full permissions for the sample table.

1. Open `DynamoDBSampleSwift.xcworkspace`.

1. Open `Constants.swift` and update the following lines with the constants from step 1:

        let CognitoRegionType = AWSRegionType.Unknown
        let DefaultServiceRegionType = AWSRegionType.Unknown
        let CognitoIdentityPoolId = "YourCognitoIdentityPoolId"
        let AWSSampleDynamoDBTableName = "DynamoDB-OM-SwiftSample"

1. Build and run the sample app.
